Refactor: Revert contenteditable experiment and document flexbox issue

Reverted changes related to the div[contenteditable] experiment in index.html, style.css, and script.js as it introduced new layout issues.

Updated GEMINI.md to reflect the unsuccessful attempt and document the persistent flexbox stretching bug for textarea and pre elements.

Updated README.md to include a section on "Ongoing Development / Known Issues" to inform about the unresolved flexbox layout problem.

Restored style.css from a partial backup provided by the user after it was inadvertently emptied.
